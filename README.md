## Using the ircbot
You can start the bot using the gradle wrapper in the base directory. Use `gradlew run` on Linux or `gradlew.bat run` on Windows.
On the first start, the bot will create config files in your home directory. Find the `.tay/configs/` directory and create a copy of the `example.json` file. Add irc server details here. There is also a `user.json` file for api keys and other user specific configurations. Some modules may require an api key to work properly. Once configured, restart the bot.
